## Overview

Just finish a bootcamp? Trying to land your first job as a software/ cloud/ devops engineer?

Learn how to deploy your app's infrastructure and stand out from the crowd. Even better, you can use this project as a way to write your first tech content with some help from our community!

This repo will will serve as a place for industry professionals to share their blogs/ tutorials as well as a place for new engineers to write a blog(s)/ tutorial(s) as a means to learn a topic(s).

The project content will focus on cloud, devops, and infrastructure as means to act as a side-car curriculum to a traditional full stack bootcamp.

<code>Please help our reach by starring the repo and sharing the link with your bootcamp cohort!</code>

## Target Audience

This repo can be used by anyone to learn about cloud/ devops/ infra, but it is specifically tailored to individuals with some software engineering experience who are looking to learn how to deploy their code.

In short, if you describe yourself as one of the following you are in the right place:

- a recent or soon to be full stack software engineering bootcamp graduate
- a career changer looking to get into a cloud/ devops role
- a college computer science major wanting to learn how to deploy your code to a production environment
- a tech professional looking to give back by sharing your knowledge via written tutorials/ blogs OR by reviewing others' articles

## Project Structure

Perhaps the most challenging aspect of this project will organizing it into a chronological curriculum as people continue to add articles. As a result, there will be a loose structure in the beginning by topics.

There is folder named [Static-Links](Static-Links) where all of the articles and assets will be posted without any file structure. This will allow for the a static url to be used for social media/ portfolios, that way I can continuously re-structure the project without breaking links.

In terms of general style guide, folders will capitalize each word and use "-" delimiters, and all project/ content files will be all lowercase and also use "-" delimiters.

Each article consists of two components:

1. The markdown (.md) file
2. An "assets" folder for storing resources like images that need to be referenced in the markdown file

## How To Contribute

Welcome, and thank you for your interest in contributing!

There are 4 ways to contribute:

1. You are new to tech and you will use your contribution as way to learn a topic for the first time
2. You have some experience in tech, get added as an admin, and review others' articles in pull requests
3. You are an industry professional and you add a blog/ tutorial in the domain of your expertise
4. You star the repo and share it with someone who could use it

Contributing is the best way to learn. You will learn 4X as much writing an article than you will reading an article. This is also the way to get some great public content for your LinkedIn, portfolio, resume, and personal website.

If you are already an industry professional, then this is a great way to give back on your own time without any obligation to your already busy schedule.
